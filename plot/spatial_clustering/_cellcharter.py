    """
    Train an scVI model for dimensionality reduction on spatial transcriptomics data.

    Sets up and trains a Variational Inference model (scVI) on the provided AnnData
    object. The model learns a low-dimensional latent representation of gene expression
    that accounts for technical noise and batch effects.

    Parameters
    ----------
    adata : AnnData
        Annotated data matrix containing gene expression counts. Must be compatible
        with scVI's data requirements (raw counts recommended).
    epoch: int, default = 20
        Maximum number of training epochs. Early stopping may halt training before
        this limit is reached. Default is 20.

    Returns
    -------
    scvi.model.SCVI
        A trained scVI model. The latent representation can be extracted via
        ``model.get_latent_representation()``.

    Notes
    -----
    The model is configured with:
    - 1 hidden layer (``n_layers=1``)

    loss begins to plateau or diverge from the training loss.

    End-to-end CellCharter pipeline for spatial domain identification.

       a prior call to :func:`prepare_cellcharter` or :func:`stability_cellcharter` —

    Parameters
    ----------
    adata : AnnData
        Annotated data matrix containing raw gene expression counts and

        ``adata.obs`` to distinguish tissue sections.
    n_clusters : int, default = 18
        Number of spatial domains (GMM components) to identify. Use
        :func:`stability_cellcharter` beforehand to inform this choice.
    output_dir : Path or None, optional
        Directory where outputs are saved. If ``None`` the ``.h5ad`` file
        is written to the current working directory and figures are not 
        saved to disk.
    plot : bool, optional
        If ``True``, display the scVI training loss curve after model fitting
        (only relevant if ``X_cellcharter`` doesn't already exist, or if
        ``force_recompute=True``).
        Default is ``True``.
    epoch: int, default = 20
        Maximum number of training epochs. Only takes effect if
        ``X_cellcharter`` doesn't already exist or ``force_recompute=True``
        — otherwise it's silently unused, so a warning is printed if it
        differs from being applied.
    library_key : str, default = "sample"
        Column in ``adata.obs`` used to distinguish tissue sections or 
        samples. Same caveat as ``epoch`` above.
    force_recompute : bool, default = False
        If ``True``, always re-run scVI + neighbor aggregation even if
        ``adata.obsm["X_cellcharter"]`` already exists, using the ``epoch``
        and ``library_key`` given here.

    -------
    None
        Results are saved to disk as ``adata_with_spatial_domains.h5ad``

        the following additions:
