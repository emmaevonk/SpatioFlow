# STAIA
> *STAIA is a functional API for spatial transcriptomics with its aim to lower the computational barrier in spatial transcriptomics analysis. The software is currently focused on Xeniumd data from 10X Genomics.*

## Highlights

- End-to-end analyses in one pipeline
- Recognizing samples from the same Xenium slide
- Assigning labels to samples
- Performing QC, clustering, multimodal segmentation, assigning conditions and pseudobulk DE analysis
- Errorhandler
- Using well known tools in spatial transcriptomics, e.g. Squidpy and Scanpy

## Overview

STAIA is a functional API for analyzing spatial transcriptomics data. It provides a Command Line Interface (CLI) to perform quality control, spatial statistics, neighborhood analysis, and visualization for datasets generated with the Xenium platform from 10X Genomics.

The API is designed around a clean, functional workflow:
```py
STAIA.method()
```

This makes it easy to build reproducible spatial analysis pipelines with minimal boilerplate.

## Features
STAIA supports a wide range of spatial transcriptomics analyses.

### Input/Output
The input and output for every function is mentioned in the documentation. The input is most commonly a SpatialData or an AnnData object.  

### Quality control
- Automatic QC metric calculation
- Data-driven filtering recommendations
- Cell- and gene-level diagnostics

### Spatial Analysis
- Neighbor enrichment / cell-cell interaction analysis
- Spatial neighborhood constructuren
- Spatial statistics and summary metrics

### Visualization
- High-resolution spatial plotting
- Overlay gene expression or cell annotations
- Quick visualization with:
```py
STAIA.plot_image()
```

### Metrics & Diagnostics
- Dataset-level summary statistics
- Spatial structure evaluation
- Analysis-ready feature generation
